Shift Manager lets you assign workers to their shifts for your workplace. 

All you need is a table of workers, and the maximum number of hours they work each week. Then enter the details of your workplace into the settings, such as how many days you are open, how many hours, what times, and we will assign worked to fill the shifts.
